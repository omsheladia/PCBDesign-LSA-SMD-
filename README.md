# PCBDesign-LSA
  Behind the Designing of the Line Sensing Array(L.S.A)

## Using kiCAD - Open Source Software
This repository contains hardware design files and datasheets for the Line Sensor Array. This project is still in development and is not ready for release yet.
Coming soon with a finalised touch.

## Features
* Components can be proctured easily.
* Easy connections for output signals.
* Compact enough to fit into any project.
* Distinguished trace widths for Signal and Power Routes.
 
## Uses
* Obstacle detection on a clear path.
* Line Following.
* Distinguish Colours on a path.

## Components Used
Component | Description
--------- | -----------
LM324 I.C. | Op-Amp I.C.
Photodiode | Absorb light
Resistor | Limit Current
LED | Emit Light
FRC Connector | Connect PCB with other circuits
14 Pin I.C. Socket | Plug LM324 I.C.
